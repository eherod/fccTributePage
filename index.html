          <h2>Here is a brief timeline of Miyamoto's accomplishments</h2>
          <div class="list-div">


          <ul>

            <li><strong>1977</strong> - Miyamoto joins Nintendo, becomming their first employed artist.</li>
            <li><strong>1977 - 1981</strong> - He is given the task of developing an arcade version platform game. The result was <em>Donkey Kong</em>, which was released to the American market in 1981. </li>
            <li><strong>1982</strong> - Donkey Kong 2 is released</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Donkey Kong 3 is released</li>
            <li><strong>1981 - 1983</strong> - Miyamoto develops a game around the jump man, Mario, from <em>Donkey Kong</em>. He gives Mario a brother, Luigi, and places them in a platform game which would become the original <em>Mario Bros</em> - the precurser to <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></li>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> - The Nintendo Famicon is released in Japan along with Miyamoto's creation <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Another Miyamoto title, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> is released. This video game was considered groundbreaking in scope and required the implementation of new chip technology in order to support the size of the game. This year also saw the release of the sequel to <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in Japan. This version was deemed too difficult for American audiences and so was never released in the U.S. on the NES. The U.S. release of <em>Super Mario Bros. 2 </em> was reworked from an already existing Japanese release.</li>
            <li><strong>1988</strong> - <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> is released. This would eventually become one of the most financially successful video games of all time, selling more than 17 million copies world-wide.</li>
            <li><strong>1996</strong> - <em>Super Mario 64</em> is released.</li>
            <li><strong>1998</strong> - <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocorina of Time</em> is released.</li>
            <li><strong>2000 - present</strong> - Produced various games for Nintendo Game Cube, Wii, DS, and Switch consoles.</li>

            The person next to you is a warrior and the space that appears empty is a door
            to another world? What if something appears that shouldn't? You either
            dismiss it or accept that there is more to the world than you think.
            Perhaps it is really a doorway, and if you choose to go inside, you'll find many
             unexpected things." <br><br>--Shigeru Miyamoto</em></blockquote>
